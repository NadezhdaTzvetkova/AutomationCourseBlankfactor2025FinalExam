School API - Automated BDD Tests
This project implements automated API tests for the School API using Behavior Driven Development (BDD) in C# with the RestSharp library and SpecFlow/Reqnroll.

üß™ Project Overview
The goal of this project is to test the School API‚Äôs key functionalities using BDD-style scenarios. These tests are written in Gherkin syntax and executed through a structured test automation framework that ensures readability, reliability, and clear reporting.

‚úÖ Key Features
Written in C# using BDD (Behavior Driven Development)
Uses RestSharp for API calls
Integrated with Reqnroll for Gherkin-style step definitions
Includes logging for all test steps
Generates HTML test reports with clear human-readable messages
Handles errors gracefully with meaningful feedback in the report and logs

üìã Functionalities Covered:
The test suite covers 5 core functionalities of the School API, such as:

1. Login and token retrieval
2. Creating a class by a teacher
3. Adding a student to a class
4. Adding a grade to a student
5. Parent views their child's grades

Tests list:

1. Create user
2. Sign in and receive a token
3. Try to create user that exists
4. Connecting parent to student
5. View student grades
6. Try to view student grades with invalid id
7. Try to view student grades, who isn't connected to parent
8. Create a class
9. Add stuednt to class
10. Try to add stuednt to class with invalid class id
11. Add and update grade
12. Try to add grade to student with invalid id

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
.NET 6 / .NET Core
C#
Reqnroll (for BDD)
RestSharp (for HTTP requests)
Extent Reports (for HTML reporting)
NLog (for logging)
NUnit (as the test runner)

üß∞ Installation
Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:M370D1/CourseProjectSchoolAPI.git
cd CourseProjectSchoolAPI
```
Restore NuGet packages:
```bash
dotnet restore
```
Build the project:
```bash
dotnet build
```
üöÄ Running the Tests
You can run the test suite using the command:
```bash
dotnet test
```
Test results will be available as:
HTML report (e.g., /Reports/ExtentReport.html)
Log file (e.g., /Logs/logfile.txt)

üßæ Error Handling
All failed tests are caught gracefully with:

Human-readable error messages in the test report
Corresponding log entries with detailed debug info

Note: This project is for educational and demo purposes and assumes access to the School API endpoints with valid authentication.

   During the testing process, several automated BDD tests have failed, revealing important bugs within the School API. Specifically, it was found that the API allows the creation of multiple classes with the same name, which can lead to data ambiguity. Additionally, a student can be added to a class using an invalid class_id, indicating insufficient validation. Another issue was detected where a grade can be added to a subject even when the required student_id is missing.
